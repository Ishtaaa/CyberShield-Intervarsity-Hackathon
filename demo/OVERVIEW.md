## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration
``` c
With the uprise of technology, many business's and individual's daily activities are becoming digitized, but they are unaware of the good digital safety practices. 
My aim was to find a new and exciting way for users to learn how to stay safe on the internet. South Africans are rapidly adopting digital services like mobile money, government platforms, and social media. However, they face a critical vulnerability gap - limited awareness of online scams, phishing attacks, and mobile fraud makes them easy targets for cybercriminals

 -**AI implementation: ** AI guidance for users to provide a personalized experience
 -** Accessibility:** Different language and mobile support
