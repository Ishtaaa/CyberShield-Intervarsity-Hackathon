# Acknowledgements

This document lists all **third-party repositories, modules, libraries, frameworks, APIs, and datasets** used in this project.  
I did use AI for story guidance and implementation of automated story telling, aswell as parts of my draggable class and white noise animation during the intro. Most parts of the source code that have been AI generated have been marked as such.
